# Movie Rating Web App

This is my first full stack application. It's made using Spring Boot and React JS. Also, my first time using pgAdmin, Postman, Heroku and Netlify.

Many thanks to [Nelio Alves](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3twHmWQwtqEO7u-gB_2f7g) for the amazing 3-days immersion. Took me almost 10 hours to create everything and it was worth!
